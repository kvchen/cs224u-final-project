       "0   People loooooove quoting Warren Buffett here. Little do people realize they aren't billionaires with billions in cash waiting on the side lines for the next big market crash. Does Buffett add to his positions when he can, oh yes he does, but he always, always keeps lots of cash as well. Now...I don't have billions in cash, so I'd rather simply buy at a good time and hold until a great time.\\n\\nNot holding through this downturn has been the difference between me having no cash, and being down...   \n",
